<p>My name is Paul Joiner and I am an Android Developer, Writer, Musician, and Nap Connoisseur currently based in Austin, Texas. Over the last several months, I have made the transition from work in sales and retail to mobile software development (thanks in large part to training from General Assembly and Google's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/android-development-immersive">Android Development Immersive</a> course). Thank you for visiting my portfolio! This page will be updated frequently as new projects are completed. Below are descriptions of my finished projects, which can be found in my GitHub repository.</p>

<p>My final class project for the Android Development Immersive was to make an app of my choosing that incorporated content from an API. I chose to make a movie-discovery tool that allowed users to input a few search parameters in order to find a list of movie recommendations. For this app, I used the API from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">themoviedb.org</a> in order to query their database and return lists of movie suggestions. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jetsetpaul.movienerd">MovieNerd</a> is available for free in the Google Play Store! </p>

<p>Our second class project (for the Android Development Immersive) required a functioning E-Commerce application where users could browse through a list of products, search for specific items, and add or remove items from a shopping cart. I designed an app that would sell both music and physical merchandise from my band First Thought Worst Thought as well as items from our friends' bands. This was a very exciting opportunity for me to demonstrate my knowledge of newly learned concepts such as Fragments, Recycler Views, SQLite, and embedded media players. </p>
