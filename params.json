Over the last several months, I have made the transition from work in sales and retail to mobile software development (thanks in large part to training from General Assembly and Google's [Android Development Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/android-development-immersive) course). Thank you for visiting my portfolio! This page will be updated frequently as new projects are completed. Below are descriptions of my finished projects, which can be found in my GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n### E-Commerce App (First Store Worst Store)\r\nOur second class project (for the Android Development Immersive) required a functioning E-Commerce application where users could browse through a list of products, search for specific items, and add or remove items from a shopping cart. I designed an app that would sell both music and physical merchandise from my band [First Thought Worst Thought](https://awkwardbullshit.bandcamp.com/) as well as items from our friends' bands. This was a very exciting opportunity for me to demonstrate my knowledge of newly learned concepts such as Fragments, Recycler Views, SQLite, and embedded media players. \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nI can be reached via email at pauluntakjoiner@gmail.com\r\n",
